# Troubleshooting polkit rule for udisksctl power-off

This guide helps you verify and debug the polkit rule that allows a specific user to run `udisksctl power-off -b /dev/sdb` without a password.

---

## 1. Verify the exact username

In the terminal, run:

```bash
whoami
```

Make sure the username exactly matches the one in your polkit rule (e.g., `"allowed_user"`), including case sensitivity.

---

## 2. Test with a polkit rule that allows everything for that user (for testing only)

Edit or create the polkit rule file `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/52-udisks-poweroff-user.rules` to the following:

```javascript
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if (subject.user == "allowed_user") {
        return polkit.Result.YES;
    }
});
```

Save the file and restart polkit:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart polkit
```

Then try again:

```bash
udisksctl power-off -b /dev/sdb
```

If it still asks for a password, this means the polkit rule is not being applied or polkit is not correctly interpreting the rules.

---

## 3. Check that the file has correct permissions

Run:

```bash
ls -l /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/52-udisks-poweroff-user.rules
```

The file should be readable by everyone, like this:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root ...
```

If needed, fix the permissions with:

```bash
sudo chmod 644 /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/52-udisks-poweroff-user.rules
```

---

If problems persist, further debugging or alternative sudoers configuration may be required.
